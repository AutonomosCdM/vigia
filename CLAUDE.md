# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview
Vigia is a medical-grade pressure injury (LPP - Lesiones Por Presi√≥n) detection system using computer vision and AI. The system implements a secure 3-layer architecture for healthcare compliance (HIPAA, ISO 13485, SOC2) with messaging integration (WhatsApp, Slack) and comprehensive audit capabilities.

## Architecture Overview

### üèóÔ∏è 3-Layer Security Architecture
The system implements strict separation of concerns across three layers:

**Layer 1 - Input Isolation (Zero Medical Knowledge)**
- `vigia_detect/messaging/whatsapp/isolated_bot.py` - WhatsApp Bot with no medical data access
- `vigia_detect/core/input_packager.py` - Standardizes inputs without medical analysis  
- `vigia_detect/core/input_queue.py` - Encrypted temporal storage with session tokens

**Layer 2 - Medical Orchestration**
- `vigia_detect/core/medical_dispatcher.py` - Routes based on medical content and urgency
- `vigia_detect/core/triage_engine.py` - Applies medical rules for clinical urgency assessment
- `vigia_detect/core/session_manager.py` - Manages temporal isolation with 15-minute timeouts

**Layer 3 - Specialized Medical Systems**
- `vigia_detect/systems/clinical_processing.py` - LPP detection and medical analysis
- `vigia_detect/systems/medical_knowledge.py` - Medical protocols and knowledge base
- `vigia_detect/systems/human_review_queue.py` - Human escalation with priority queues

**Cross-Cutting Services**
- `vigia_detect/utils/audit_service.py` - Complete audit trail with 7-year retention
- `vigia_detect/interfaces/slack_orchestrator.py` - Medical team notifications
- `vigia_detect/utils/access_control_matrix.py` - Granular permissions by layer and role

### Security & Compliance
- **Medical data encryption** at rest using Fernet symmetric encryption
- **Session-based temporal isolation** prevents data persistence beyond medical need
- **Complete audit trail** for regulatory compliance (HIPAA/SOC2/ISO 13485)
- **Least privilege access** with granular permissions matrix
- **Human-in-the-loop** escalation for ambiguous medical cases

### External Services
- **MedGemma Local** for medical analysis and natural language processing (fully local, HIPAA-compliant)
- **Anthropic Claude** for medical analysis and natural language processing (optional API-based)
- **Supabase** for persistent medical data storage (shared with autonomos-agent project)
- **Twilio** for WhatsApp messaging integration
- **Slack API** for medical team notifications  
- **Redis** for medical protocol caching and vector embeddings

### Testing Architecture
- **Comprehensive mocking** of external services (Twilio, Slack, Supabase)
- **Medical data safety** using synthetic patient data in tests
- **Async test support** in webhook module with VCR for HTTP recording
- **Test categorization** with markers: unit, integration, e2e, medical, security, smoke
- **Coverage reporting** enabled for webhook module

### Medical Workflow
The system handles the complete medical workflow from input to clinical decision:
1. **Input Reception**: WhatsApp Bot receives images/messages from healthcare staff
2. **Medical Triage**: Triage Engine assesses clinical urgency and routes appropriately  
3. **Clinical Analysis**: Specialized systems perform LPP detection and grading
4. **Human Escalation**: Complex cases route to qualified medical personnel
5. **Team Notification**: Slack Orchestrator delivers results to appropriate medical teams
6. **Audit & Compliance**: All actions logged for medical-legal traceability

### Key Configuration
- Environment variables managed through `.env` files with secure credential handling
- Medical protocols stored in Redis with vector search capabilities
- Session timeouts enforced at 15 minutes for temporal data isolation
- Multi-language support (Spanish/English) for medical notifications

### AI Integration Architecture
The system integrates multiple AI approaches for medical analysis:

**MedGemma Local (Recommended)**
- `vigia_detect/ai/medgemma_local_client.py` - Complete local MedGemma implementation
- Models: 4B multimodal (text+image) and 27B text-only
- Features: Quantization, caching, multimodal support, medical context integration
- Benefits: Full privacy, no API costs, HIPAA-compliant, predictable latency
- Setup: Use `scripts/setup_medgemma_local.py` for automated configuration

**External AI APIs (Fallback)**
- Anthropic Claude for complex medical reasoning when local AI insufficient
- Used only when MedGemma local cannot provide adequate analysis
- Requires careful privacy and compliance consideration

### Data Architecture
**Redis vs Supabase Usage**
- **Redis**: Medical protocol cache, vector embeddings, session data (temporal)
- **Supabase**: Permanent medical records, audit trails, user management (persistent)
- **Local Storage**: AI model cache, temporary image processing

### Medical Decision Framework
The system implements evidence-based medical decisions with complete scientific justification:

**Evidence-Based Decision Engine** (`vigia_detect/systems/medical_decision_engine.py`):
- All clinical decisions backed by NPUAP/EPUAP/PPPIA 2019 guidelines
- Evidence levels A/B/C with specific scientific references
- Automatic escalation protocols for patient safety
- Complete audit trail for regulatory compliance

**Medical Documentation** (`docs/medical/`):
- `NPUAP_EPUAP_CLINICAL_DECISIONS.md` - Complete scientific justification framework
- Evidence-based recommendations with clinical rationale
- Confidence thresholds based on medical safety protocols
- Patient-specific considerations (diabetes, anticoagulation, etc.)

### Recent Architecture Implementation
The system recently implemented a complete 3-layer security architecture to meet medical compliance requirements. All new development should follow the layered access patterns and maintain strict separation between input processing, medical orchestration, and specialized clinical systems.

The MedGemma local integration represents a major shift toward fully private medical AI processing, eliminating external API dependencies for core medical analysis while maintaining professional-grade capabilities.

Latest additions: 
1. Evidence-based medical decision system ensuring all automated clinical decisions include scientific justification and comply with international medical standards.
2. Asynchronous medical pipeline with Celery preventing timeouts in critical medical workflows, featuring specialized task queues, retry policies, and failure escalation for patient safety.
3. Comprehensive NPUAP/EPUAP clinical documentation framework with complete scientific references and evidence levels (A/B/C) for all medical recommendations.
4. Medical-grade failure handling with automatic escalation to human review for patient safety and regulatory compliance.

### Asynchronous Pipeline Architecture (NEW - v1.2.0)
The system now implements a fully asynchronous medical pipeline using Celery to prevent timeouts and blocking:

**Pipeline Components**:
- `vigia_detect/core/async_pipeline.py` - Central orchestrator for async medical workflows
- `vigia_detect/tasks/medical.py` - Medical analysis tasks (image_analysis, risk_score, triage)
- `vigia_detect/tasks/audit.py` - Async audit logging for compliance
- `vigia_detect/tasks/notifications.py` - Async medical notifications (Slack, alerts)
- `vigia_detect/utils/failure_handler.py` - Specialized medical failure handling with escalation

**Key Features**:
- **Timeout Prevention**: 3-5 minute limits for medical tasks vs 30-60 second blocking
- **Specialized Queues**: medical_priority, image_processing, notifications, audit_logging
- **Medical Retry Policies**: Max 3 retries with escalation to human review
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Pipeline status tracking and health monitoring
- **Failure Escalation**: Automatic escalation for critical medical failures

## Mode Instructions

### Planning Mode Instructions
When user starts a message with `/plan` or requests planning mode:
- **DO NOT execute any code or create files**
- Focus on ideation, brainstorming, architecture design, and strategy
- Provide detailed analysis, options, tradeoffs, and recommendations
- Ask clarifying questions to better understand requirements
- Create conceptual frameworks and high-level designs
- Research and compare different approaches
- Only move to implementation when explicitly asked to exit planning mode

### YOLO Mode Instructions
When user starts a message with `/yolo` or requests YOLO mode:
- **Execute tasks immediately without permission confirmations**
- Skip safety prompts and user confirmations (equivalent to --dangerously-skip-permissions)
- Focus on rapid execution and immediate results
- Prioritize speed over cautious verification
- Assume user has already considered risks and wants immediate action
- Ideal for experienced developers who know what they're doing
- Use with caution - no safety nets or confirmation dialogs

### Medical Development Guidelines
- **Evidence-Based Decisions**: All medical logic must reference NPUAP/EPUAP/PPPIA guidelines
- **Scientific Justification**: Clinical recommendations require evidence level (A/B/C) and references
- **Safety First**: Low confidence medical decisions must escalate to human review
- **Audit Trail**: All medical decisions must be fully traceable for compliance
- **Test-Driven Medical**: Medical functionality requires synthetic patient testing
- **Privacy Compliance**: Medical data processing must remain local when possible
