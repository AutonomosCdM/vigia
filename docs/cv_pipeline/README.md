# Vigia CV Pipeline Module

## Overview
This module implements the computer vision pipeline for processing images and detecting Lesiones por Presi√≥n (LPP) within the ADK (Agent Development Kit) architecture. It includes components for image preprocessing and YOLOv5-based detection integrated with the ImageAnalysisAgent.

## Project Structure
The `cv_pipeline` module is located in `vigia_detect/cv_pipeline/`.
- `__init__.py`: Initializes the module and exposes key classes.
- `detector.py`: Implements the `LPPDetector` class for YOLOv5 inference.
- `preprocessor.py`: Implements the `ImagePreprocessor` class for image transformations.
- `tests/`: Contains unit tests for the pipeline components.
    - `test_detector.py`: Tests for the `LPPDetector`.
    - `test_preprocessor.py`: Tests for the `ImagePreprocessor`.
    - `data/`: Sample images for testing.

## Features
- **Image Preprocessing:**
    - Resizing to a target size (default 640x640).
    - Normalization of pixel values.
    - Optional removal of EXIF metadata for privacy.
    - Optional face detection and blurring for privacy.
    - Optional contrast enhancement for better erythema identification.
- **LPP Detection:**
    - Wrapper around a YOLOv5 model trained for pressure ulcer detection.
    - Supports different YOLOv5 model types (`yolov5s`, `yolov5m`, `yolov5l`).
    - Configurable confidence threshold for detections.
    - Extracts bounding boxes, confidence scores, and stage classifications (0-4).

## Installation
The core dependencies for this module are included in the project's centralized requirements.
```bash
pip install -r config/requirements.txt
```
Note: The YOLOv5 model itself is loaded via `torch.hub`. For the specific YOLOv5-Wound model, manual download or cloning as a submodule might be required in a production setup (currently uses a generic model as a placeholder).

## Usage
The `cv_pipeline` module is typically used by the ImageAnalysisAgent within the ADK architecture or the CLI (`vigia_detect/cli/process_images_refactored.py`).

### Example Usage (within ADK Agent):
```python
from vigia_detect.cv_pipeline import ImagePreprocessor, LPPDetector
import cv2

# Initialize preprocessor and detector
preprocessor = ImagePreprocessor(target_size=(640, 640), enhance_contrast=True)
detector = LPPDetector(model_type='yolov5s', conf_threshold=0.3)

# Load and preprocess an image
image_path = 'path/to/your/image.jpg'
processed_image = preprocessor.preprocess(image_path)

# Perform detection
detection_results = detector.detect(processed_image)

# Process results
if detection_results['detections']:
    print(f"Detected {len(detection_results['detections'])} LPPs:")
    for det in detection_results['detections']:
        print(f"- Stage: {det['stage']}, Confidence: {det['confidence']:.2f}, Bbox: {det['bbox']}")
else:
    print("No LPPs detected.")

# You can also visualize results using image_utils
# from vigia_detect.utils.image_utils import save_detection_result
# output_path = 'path/to/save/annotated_image.jpg'
# save_detection_result(processed_image, detection_results, output_path)
```

## Development Notes
- **Model Integration:** The current implementation uses `torch.hub.load` with a generic YOLOv5 model. For the specific YOLOv5-Wound model (`calisma/pressure-ulcer`), the model weights need to be downloaded or the repository cloned and referenced correctly in `detector.py`.
- **Face Detection:** The face detection feature relies on OpenCV's Haar Cascades. Ensure OpenCV is installed with the necessary data files.
- **Testing:** Comprehensive unit tests are provided in the `tests/` subdirectory. Run them frequently during development.

## ADK Integration
This module integrates with the ImageAnalysisAgent (`vigia_detect/agents/image_analysis_agent.py`) for medical image processing within the agent-based architecture.
